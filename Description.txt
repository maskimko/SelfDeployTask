Write a daemon in any language (Python or Go preferably) which will:

    Be able to create VPC, ELB and 2 EC2 instances.
    Be able to deploy itself to AWS or GCE.
    Limit access to itself to only the IP address from which it was started.
    Will listen on socket (not http) and react on 2 commands:
        "stop" - will remove the deployment completely.
        "moveto '%region%'‚Äù - will create another deployment in the specified region and destroy itself completely in the current location (except initial run from the local computer).

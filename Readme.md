This repository contains solution of the test task given to me.

Description of the task is stored in _Description.txt_ file

To launch this code you should have installed Go language compiler.
Preliminary steps:
 - Cd to the project directory
 - Hit the command _go get_
Command to launch: _go run main.go_

Or you can download a precompiled binary and launch it

*Note 1:* It is better to launch this code on GNU/Linux
*Note 2:* If you use Mac OS, AWS EC2 instances will not be able to execute the deployed binary, because they are Linux not Mac OS
